I attended Huawei Hackathon 2023 in Stockholm. We implemented an algorithm for optimizing the deployment of Radio Access Networks (RAN) computations in the context of 5G telecommunications. We placed 5:th in the competition out of 73 total teams.

It was a challenging yet rewarding experience, packed with learning, even though programming for 24 hours straight was absolutely exhausting.
