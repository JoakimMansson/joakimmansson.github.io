I had the role as a Low Voltage Engineer in Halmstad University Solar Team (HUST). In HUST we developed a purely solar powered vehicle, designed to compete in Australia in the Bridgestone World Solar challenge. We worked on this vehicle for 2 years and I was responsible for all the software. One such software implementation was the electrical control unit (ECU). The ECU handled driver input through steering wheel, motor control, regenerative braking, drive mode selection, safety management, battery monitoring, and more. I also developed the wireless data transmission system from the solar vehicle, which was used to monitor critical data.

The vehicle successfully completed a 1070 km drive with zero electrical issues in Australia.
