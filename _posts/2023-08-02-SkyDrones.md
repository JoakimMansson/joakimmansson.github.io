I had the incredible opportunity to work with SkyDrones, a drone company in Porto Alegre, where I implemented a CAN communication system that brought significant cost savings to both the company and its customers. My role also involved developing and refining algorithms, including object avoidance, and actively contributing to the integration of new features into ArduPilot's open-source code for the company.
